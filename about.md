I read philosophy, product development, and a whole lot of non-fiction. I love indie music and psychedelic rock, and I like to brag about how I knew Tame Impala before their Currents album dropped. Lonerism is probably my favorite album.

I've transitioned from building AI tools in Python to doing Data Science in a Start-Up which has over 20 million users now. Currently, I work with tools on the Cloud and do Data Engineering to support my existence.

### Reach Out To Me

I rant a lot on twitter and here's my [[linkedin::https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyandtheworld/]] profile. If you want to grab a coffee or a beer (I prefer the latter), I'm all down for it as long as you're buying. :P

### What Am I Up to Now?

I work part-time for a US-based hardware company where I work on architecting their Cloud and databases, and do a lot of analytics. Rest of the time, I'm working on my start-up [reallyconfused.co](https://reallyconfused.co). 

As a hobby, I'm learning how to build scalable applications in Golang while YOLOing my money away on Crypto!
