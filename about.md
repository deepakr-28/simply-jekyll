I read a lot about philosophy, product development, and a whole lot of non-fiction. I love indie music and psychedelic rock. I like to brag about how I knew Tame Impala before their Currents album dropped and he went mainstream. Lonerism is hands-down my favorite album.

I started my journey into technology by learning and implementing cool stuff using Machine Learning and Python. From then on, I've been lucky enough to participate in various international programs and even co-found an Enterprise AI Start-up.

I've transitioned from building AI tools in Python to doing Data Science in a Start-Up which has over 20 million active users now. Right now, I genuinely love working with tools on the Cloud and do Data Engineering.

## Reach out to me

I rant a lot on twitter and here's my fancy [[linkedin::https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyandtheworld/]] profile. If you want to grab a coffee or a beer (I prefer the latter), I'm all down for it as long as you're buying. :P

I'd love to receive an e-mail from you! Drop a an email([[guyandtheworld@gmail.com::mailto:guyandtheworld@gmail.com]]) if you want to flex your mix-tape.

## Contributions and Failures

- **EvalAI and EvalAI-CLI:** Definitely my most significant open-source contribution! I've learned so much from working on these projects about AWS, backend, and good code. The people who I worked with here are just brilliant.
- **Let's Predict the Recession:** Not really a failure since this project helped me get a Data Science internship at Trell! They have over 20 million active users now and I really built some cool stuff while here and made a really good network!
- **Arvy:** Kind of a failure. Meaning I was successful in building what I intended - a fancy AR-based story-telling application but I didn't do sales or market it enough. Thinking back, if I did go out and put it out there, something definitely would've come out of this.
- **Makri:** Not really a failure because I got the opportunity to go to Singapore to present a talk on the impact of NLP. This thing was all about "future potential". Alas, this was also abandoned.
- **Snapdiet:** Complete and utter failure, since again I built this without doing Customer Development. Did I ask myself what would set this apart from the thousand other dieting apps? No. Did I talk with people who diet and track food? Also, no. Did I do it for the sake of making an app? Yes. Was it a good lesson? Kinda.

# What Am I Up to Now?

I work on my start-up [alrt.ai](http://alrt.ai). To pay the bills, I work for a US-based hardware company where I work on upgrading their Cloud Environment and databases and do a lot of analytics.

As a hobby, I'm learning how to build scalable applications in Golang while also learning how to do Customer Development and do sales!

# Books I Love!

- **Zero to One:** This book changed my outlook on life and probably why I became a workaholic.
- **Sapiens:** Reinforced my beliefs in existentialism and the futility of life.
- **Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage:** The power of human will. A very productive read which made living at home during the lock-down easier.
- **The Tipping Point:** Malcolm Gladwell is probably my favourite author.
- **Into Thin Air:** The most entertaining book I've read.
