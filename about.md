i read. a lot. i love indie music and psychedelic rock. i've transitioned from building AI tools in python for machine learning and perception lab at virginia tech to doing data science in a start-up that has over 30 million users now. currently, i work with tools on the cloud, unity (game dev with c#) and data engineering. i've also built multiple start-ups/products most of which failed to be profitable businesses.
